Let's break down the command you provided:

```bash
netstat -a | tee netstat-a.sh | nvim -
```

1. **`netstat -a`**: 
   - This displays all active TCP and UDP connections and listening ports.
   
2. **`| tee netstat-a.sh`**: 
   - The `tee` command saves the output of `netstat -a` into a file called `netstat-a.sh`, while also passing that output through to the next command in the pipeline.
   
3. **`| nvim -`**:
   - This opens the output in `nvim` (Neovim). The `-` means it will read from stdin (the piped output from `tee`), so it opens the result directly in the text editor.

### Result:
- The `netstat` output will be written to a file (`netstat-a.sh`) and simultaneously opened in Neovim for editing or viewing.

Let me know if you need help refining or modifying this!

In the last part of the command (`nvim -`), the `-` is a special argument that tells `nvim` (Neovim) to read from **stdin** (standard input), meaning it will accept the input piped to it.

### Explanation:
Normally, when you open `nvim`, you specify a file to edit (e.g., `nvim myfile.txt`). But when you use `-`, you're telling `nvim` to open whatever is being passed through the pipe.

In this case, the output from the previous commands (`netstat -a | tee netstat-a.sh`) is being passed to `nvim`, and `nvim -` allows you to directly open that output as if it were a file.

So, in summary:
- **`-`** in `nvim -` means: "read from the standard input (stdin) and open it in the editor."
